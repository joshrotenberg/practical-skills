# Gardening — Soil Amendment, Pruning, and Pest Control

## Overview

Gardening is the management of plant growth through manipulation of soil, light, water, and nutrients, with periodic intervention to control pests, disease, and competition from weeds. Success depends on understanding your specific conditions: USDA hardiness zone, microclimate, soil type, sun exposure, and water availability. No amount of technique overcomes putting a shade plant in full sun or planting a zone 9 species in zone 6.

## Prerequisites

- Bypass pruners (for live wood up to 3/4" diameter). Anvil pruners crush stems; use bypass for clean cuts.
- Loppers for branches 3/4" to 1-1/2"
- Pruning saw for anything larger
- Spade and digging fork
- Soil test kit or lab submission (your county extension office typically offers this for $15–25)
- Garden hose with adjustable nozzle, or drip irrigation for beds
- Wheelbarrow or garden cart
- Gloves. Leather for thorny work, nitrile for chemical application.

## Soil

### Understanding your soil

Dig a hole 12" deep and examine the profile. Sandy soil drains quickly, warms early, and holds few nutrients. Clay soil drains slowly, stays cold, and holds nutrients tightly. Loam — a roughly equal mix of sand, silt, and clay — is the target for most garden plants.

Test drainage by filling the hole with water and timing how long it takes to drain. If it drains in under 10 minutes, the soil is too sandy and will need organic matter to improve moisture retention. If water stands for more than an hour, the soil has poor drainage and needs structural amendment or raised beds.

Get a soil test before adding anything. A soil test tells you the pH, macronutrient levels (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium), and organic matter content. Without this, you are guessing, and guessing leads to over-application of lime ("my neighbor said the soil here is acidic") or unnecessary fertilizer.

### Amending

For clay soil: incorporate 3–4" of compost into the top 8–10" of soil using a digging fork. Do not add sand to clay — unless you add enough to fundamentally change the ratio (roughly 50% by volume), you create a material that is closer to concrete than loam. Compost is the universal amendment for both clay and sand.

For acidic soil (pH below 6.0): apply pelletized lime at the rate recommended by your soil test. Lime takes 2–3 months to change pH, so apply in fall for spring planting. For alkaline soil (pH above 7.5): apply elemental sulfur. This also takes months to work.

## Pruning

### When to prune

Spring-flowering shrubs (forsythia, lilac, azalea) bloom on old wood — wood that grew the previous season. Prune immediately after flowering. If you prune in fall or winter, you remove next spring's flower buds.

Summer-flowering shrubs (butterfly bush, crape myrtle, rose of Sharon) bloom on new wood — wood that grows the current season. Prune in late winter or early spring before new growth begins.

Fruit trees are pruned in late winter while dormant, to shape the canopy, improve air circulation, and remove dead, diseased, or crossing branches.

### How to prune

Every cut should be made just outside the branch collar — the slightly swollen ridge where the branch meets the trunk or parent branch. The collar contains the tree's wound-sealing tissue. Cutting flush with the trunk removes the collar and the tree cannot close the wound, creating an entry point for decay. Leaving a long stub prevents the collar from closing over the cut.

For branches larger than 1-1/2", use the three-cut method to prevent bark tearing. First, make an undercut 6–12" from the trunk, sawing upward about one-third through the branch. Then make a top cut 1–2" further out from the undercut, sawing downward until the branch falls — the undercut prevents the bark from tearing down the trunk as the branch separates. Finally, make a clean cut just outside the branch collar to remove the remaining stub.

Do not paint or seal pruning cuts. Research over the past 40 years has consistently shown that wound dressings do not prevent decay and may actually trap moisture, promoting fungal growth.

## Pest Control

### Identification first

Do not spray anything until you have identified the pest. A significant percentage of insects in a garden are beneficial — predators, parasitoids, or pollinators. A broad-spectrum insecticide kills everything, including the predators that were keeping the pest in check, which leads to a worse outbreak a few weeks later.

Examine the damage pattern. Chewing damage (holes, notched edges) indicates caterpillars, beetles, or grasshoppers. Stippling (tiny pale dots on leaves) indicates spider mites or thrips. Sticky residue (honeydew) and sooty mold indicate aphids, scale, or whitefly. Wilting despite adequate water may indicate root-feeding grubs or borers in the stem.

Turn over leaves, check stems, and examine the soil surface around the base of the plant. Many pests feed on the undersides of leaves or at the soil line where they are not immediately visible.

### Integrated pest management

Start with the least disruptive intervention and escalate only as necessary.

**Physical removal** is the first line of defense. Hand-pick caterpillars and beetles. Knock aphids off with a strong spray of water. Remove and destroy heavily infested leaves.

If physical removal is insufficient, move to **biological control**. Encourage predators: ladybugs eat aphids, lacewing larvae eat aphids and soft-bodied insects, parasitic wasps lay eggs in caterpillars. Avoid broad-spectrum pesticides that kill these allies.

When biological control is not enough, use **targeted treatments**. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) kills caterpillars specifically and is non-toxic to other insects. Insecticidal soap controls soft-bodied insects on contact. Neem oil is a broad but relatively low-toxicity option.

**Chemical control** with conventional insecticides is a last resort. If you reach this step, re-evaluate whether the damage is actually severe enough to warrant it. A plant with 10% leaf damage from caterpillars will recover. A plant drenched in carbaryl has no beneficial insects left and is exposed to secondary pest outbreaks.

## Common Mistakes

- Planting too deep. The root flare (where the trunk widens at the base) should be at or slightly above the soil surface. A tree planted too deep develops stem rot at the buried bark. This is the single most common cause of slow decline and death in newly planted trees.
- Watering on a schedule instead of based on need. Stick a finger 2" into the soil. If it's dry, water deeply. If it's moist, leave it alone. Overwatering kills more container plants and garden plants than underwatering.
- Pruning crape myrtles by cutting all branches back to the same height every year ("crape murder"). This produces a flush of thin, weak growth with heavy flower heads that flop over. Crape myrtles need only selective removal of crossing branches and dead wood. They do not need annual decapitation.
- Applying "more is better" to fertilizer. Excess nitrogen produces lush foliage at the expense of flowers and fruit, attracts aphids, and contaminates groundwater. Follow the soil test recommendations.
