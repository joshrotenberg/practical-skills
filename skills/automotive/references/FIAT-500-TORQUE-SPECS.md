## Engine

| Fastener | Torque | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Cylinder head nuts | 18 ft-lbs | Tighten in diagonal pattern, re-torque after first heat cycle |

| Flywheel bolts | 29 ft-lbs | Use thread locker |
| Oil drain plug | 22 ft-lbs | Copper crush washer, replace at every change |
| Valve cover nuts | 7 ft-lbs | Do not overtighten — the gasket seals with minimal compression |
| Exhaust manifold nuts | 15 ft-lbs | Brass nuts recommended to prevent seizing |
| Carburetor mounting nuts | 10 ft-lbs | Overtightening warps the base gasket and creates a vacuum leak |
| Generator/alternator pivot bolt | 18 ft-lbs | |
| Distributor clamp bolt | 7 ft-lbs | Snug enough to hold position, loose enough to adjust timing |
