# Moving — Furniture Disassembly, Truck Loading, and Stair Navigation

## Overview

Moving household contents from one residence to another is a logistics and materials-handling problem. The most common injuries are lower back strains from improper lifting, crushed fingers from poor grip, and damaged walls from moving large items through tight spaces. The most common property damage is to door frames, stair railings, and the furniture itself.

A successful move is planned in reverse: start with how items will be placed in the new location, then determine truck loading order (last loaded = first unloaded), then plan the extraction path from the current location.

## Prerequisites

- Moving truck appropriately sized for the load. A 2-bedroom apartment typically requires a 15-foot truck. A 3-bedroom house typically requires a 20–26-foot truck. Err on the side of larger — an underpacked truck is easier to load than two trips.
- Moving blankets (furniture pads), at least 12 for a 2-bedroom move
- Ratchet straps (4 minimum) and rope
- Dolly: a two-wheel hand truck for boxes and appliances, and a four-wheel furniture dolly for heavy flat items
- Packing tape, bubble wrap, and boxes in uniform sizes (uniform boxes stack cleanly; random sizes create an unstable load)
- Tools for disassembly: Phillips and flathead screwdrivers, Allen key set (most flat-pack furniture uses 4mm or 5mm), adjustable wrench, zip-lock bags for hardware
- Furniture sliders (plastic discs for carpet, felt pads for hardwood)
- At least one other person. Moving a sofa alone is how you herniate a disc.

## Lifting Technique

Stand close to the object with your feet shoulder-width apart. Squat by bending at the knees and hips, keeping your back straight — not rounded, not arched. Grip the object firmly at the bottom. Lift by straightening your legs. The force should come from your quadriceps and glutes, not your lower back.

Keep the object close to your body. Holding a 50-lb box at arm's length puts roughly 500 lbs of force on your lumbar spine. The same box held against your chest puts 50 lbs on your spine.

Do not twist while carrying a load. If you need to change direction, pivot your feet and turn your entire body.

For two-person carries, designate one person as the caller. All lifts, sets, and direction changes are initiated by that person's count. "Lift on three: one, two, three." This prevents one person lifting while the other is still adjusting their grip.

## Disassembly

Disassemble everything that can be disassembled. A bed frame, a dining table, a sectional sofa — they all come apart. Moving assembled furniture through doorways and stairwells accounts for most damage to both the furniture and the building.

Photograph each assembly before disassembling. This is your reassembly reference. Remove all hardware and place it in a labeled zip-lock bag taped directly to the piece it belongs to. Do not put all hardware from the entire house into one bag. You will regret this.

Remove all drawers from dressers. A six-drawer dresser with clothes still in the drawers weighs 150+ lbs and the drawer faces will pop off if the dresser tilts. Remove the drawers, wrap the dresser, and carry the drawers separately.

## Truck Loading

Load the truck front to back, heavy items first. Refrigerators, washers, and dryers go against the front wall. Wrap them in moving blankets and strap them to the wall tie-downs.

Mattresses go upright along the side walls. A mattress laid flat on the truck floor wastes the entire floor footprint and only creates 8" of unusable height.

Sofas go in next, either upright on end or face-down. Wrap in moving blankets. Do not stack anything on upholstered surfaces — the pressure creates permanent indentations.

Build walls of boxes from floor to ceiling. Keep boxes of uniform size together and stack heavy boxes (books, dishes) on the bottom, light boxes (linens, clothes) on top. Fill every gap — a tightly packed truck does not shift during transit. A loosely packed truck has items falling and sliding on every turn and every stop.

Strap a horizontal ratchet strap across the load every 4–5 feet of depth. This creates bulkheads that prevent cascade failures if the front wall of boxes gives way.

Fragile items (mirrors, framed art, TVs) go last and are placed vertically between mattresses or padded items. Never lay a flat-screen TV face down — the screen flexes under the weight and cracks.

## Navigating Stairs with a Sofa

This is the canonical hard problem in moving. A standard interior stairway is 36" wide with a 90° landing. A standard three-seat sofa is 84" long, 36" deep, and 34" tall.

The general approach: tip the sofa onto its end (standing on one arm) so its longest dimension is vertical. The person at the top walks backward up the stairs, bearing the majority of the weight. The person at the bottom guides and stabilizes, keeping the sofa tight against the wall side of the stairway.

At the landing, the sofa must be rotated 90°. This is where most couches get stuck. With the sofa vertical on its end, walk the bottom outward from the wall while the top person pivots their end around the corner. The sofa will need to tilt forward toward the lower flight to clear the ceiling.

If it does not fit, remove the sofa legs and try again. If it still does not fit, check whether the sofa back detaches — many modern sofas have a back that unclips or unbolts.

If it truly does not fit, measure the window openings. Removing a window sash and hoisting the sofa with rope is a real option. Professional movers do this regularly.

## Common Mistakes

- Not measuring doorways, stairwells, and hallways before moving day. If the couch came in through the sliding glass door that the previous owner installed, it will not fit through the front door. Measure everything. Measure twice.
- Loading the truck with frequently needed items first. Cleaning supplies, toilet paper, a box of essentials (phone charger, medications, change of clothes, coffee maker) should be loaded last so they are available first.
- Not protecting floors. Lay down Masonite sheets or cardboard runners on hardwood floors. One pass with a hand truck loaded with a washing machine will gouge a hardwood floor down to the subfloor.
- Carrying boxes with the bottom unsealed or using old, weakened boxes for heavy items. The bottom of a box carrying books will give out in a predictable and demoralizing way.
- Not labeling boxes with both contents and destination room. "Kitchen — pots and pans" is useful at unloading. "Misc" is not.
