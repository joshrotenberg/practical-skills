# Lifeguarding — Scanning, Rescue, and Emergency Response

## Overview

A lifeguard's primary job is prevention through surveillance. The secondary job — the one people think of — is rescue. A well-run facility with attentive guards rarely requires an in-water rescue. Most drowning deaths occur when no lifeguard is present or when the guard is distracted.

Drowning does not look like drowning does in movies. There is no waving, no calling for help, no splashing. A person in the active drowning response is vertical in the water, arms pressing down laterally in an instinctive attempt to keep the mouth above the surface. The head is tilted back, mouth at water level, alternately submerging and gasping. The entire process from struggle to submersion takes 20–60 seconds. It is silent.

## Prerequisites

- Rescue tube (the red foam torpedo). This is your primary rescue device. It should be across your body with the strap over one shoulder at all times while on duty.
- Whistle on a lanyard. One short blast = attention. Two short blasts = other guards look. Three blasts or one long blast = emergency, activate EAP.
- Hip pack with pocket mask, gloves, and a pair of exam shears
- Backboard with head immobilizer and straps, positioned poolside
- AED, charged and accessible within 60 seconds of any point on the facility
- First aid kit
- Emergency action plan (EAP) reviewed and rehearsed with all staff before the facility opens

## Scanning

Scan your zone continuously. A full scan of your assigned area should take no more than 10 seconds. If you cannot see every part of the bottom and every swimmer in your zone within 10 seconds, the zone is too large or the water is too cloudy to guard safely.

Use a systematic pattern: start at one boundary of your zone, sweep across to the other, drop your gaze to the bottom, sweep back. Repeat. The pattern matters less than the discipline of maintaining it without interruption.

Watch for: swimmers in water over their depth who are not making forward progress, submerged shapes that are not moving, children who have gone from playing loudly to silent, and the head-back vertical posture described above.

Do not engage in conversation with patrons while scanning. You can answer a question in three seconds without breaking your scan pattern. A conversation is a two-minute gap in coverage. Two minutes is enough for a child to submerge, lose consciousness, and sink to the bottom.

The 10/20 rule: you should be able to identify a drowning victim within 10 seconds and reach them within 20 seconds from anywhere in your zone. If either number is not achievable given your chair position and zone size, the setup needs to change.

## Rescue: Active Drowning Victim

### Recognition and activation

Blow your whistle — one long blast. Point at the victim so other guards can track the location. If other guards are present, activate the EAP: one guard enters the water, another calls 911, a third clears the pool and retrieves the backboard and AED.

If you are the only guard, you must decide between calling 911 first or entering the water first. For an active drowning victim who is conscious, enter the water. Seconds matter. Call 911 as soon as the victim is out of the water or direct a bystander to call.

### Entry

Perform a compact jump entry from the deck if the water is at least 5 feet deep: step off the edge holding the rescue tube against your chest, enter feet-first, squeeze your legs together on entry to prevent submerging deeply. Begin swimming immediately on surfacing.

For shallow water, use a stride entry: step out with one leg forward, lean forward, and begin swimming on contact with the water. Do not dive in shallow water.

### Approach

Swim to the victim using a modified front crawl with your head up, keeping the victim in sight. Trail the rescue tube behind you on its strap.

### Contact

As you reach the victim, extend the rescue tube toward them. Push it into their chest or under their arms. An active drowning victim will grab anything that floats. Let them grab the tube — this is the point. The tube is between you and the victim. Do not allow the victim to grab you directly. A panicking adult will climb you, push you under, and now there are two drowning people.

If the victim grabs you: tuck your chin, turn away, and submerge. A drowning person releases anything that is going down. Once free, resurface, reposition, and extend the tube again.

### Tow

Once the victim has the rescue tube, kick around behind them. Reach under their arms and clamp your hands on the tube from behind. Tow them to the nearest point of safety using a breaststroke or sidestroke kick. Talk to them: "I've got you. You're okay. We're going to the wall." A conscious victim who believes they are being helped will stop fighting.

### Removal from water

At the wall, help the victim grip the edge or gutter. For a victim who cannot hold the wall, bring the backboard into the water, position the victim on it, secure the straps and head immobilizer, and lift the board onto the deck using at least two people — one at the head, one at the foot.

## Rescue: Submerged Victim

A victim found on the bottom is unconscious and not breathing. This is a cardiac arrest until proven otherwise.

Surface dive to the victim. Approach from behind, slide one arm under their armpits and across the chest, and bring them to the surface. Keep their head above water, tilt the head back slightly to open the airway.

Tow to the nearest point where they can be removed from the water. Get them on a hard, flat surface. Begin CPR immediately: 30 chest compressions at a rate of 100–120 per minute, 2" deep in an adult, followed by 2 rescue breaths using a pocket mask. Attach the AED as soon as it arrives, follow the prompts, and do not stop compressions except to deliver shocks or ventilations.

A submersion time of less than 6 minutes with immediate CPR has the highest survival rate. Every minute of delay reduces the odds significantly.

## Spinal Injury Management

If the mechanism of injury suggests a possible spinal injury — a dive into shallow water, a fall from height, a collision — assume the spine is injured until it is cleared by EMS.

Approach the victim in the water. Place one arm along the victim's sternum and one along their spine, clamping the head between your forearms (the vice grip). Roll the victim face-up if necessary, maintaining inline stabilization of the head and neck. Do not allow the head to move independently of the body.

Bring the backboard alongside the victim while maintaining stabilization. With assistance, guide the victim onto the board while keeping the spine aligned. Secure the torso straps first, then the head immobilizer, then the forehead strap. Remove the victim from the water on the board.

Do not remove the victim from the water without a backboard if spinal injury is suspected.

## Common Mistakes

- Scanning your phone instead of scanning your zone. There is nothing else to say about this. A child can drown in the time it takes to read a text message.
- Entering the water without the rescue tube. The tube is your safety margin. Without it, you are a second potential victim. The instinct is to sprint and dive in. Override that instinct. Take the tube.
- Approaching an active drowning victim face-to-face without the rescue tube between you. An adult male drowning victim will exert enough force climbing on top of you to push you under and hold you there. This is not malicious; it is instinctive. Maintain the barrier.
- Performing a standing backboard extraction with only one person. A backboard with an adult on it weighs 200+ lbs and is slippery. You need at least two people, coordinated by a count.
- Not practicing rescues regularly. Skills degrade without rehearsal. A lifeguard who has not practiced an in-water rescue in six months is significantly slower and less effective than one who drills weekly.
