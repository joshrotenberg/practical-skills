# Pipe Sizing Reference

## Copper supply pipe

| Nominal size | OD       | Wall (Type M) | Wall (Type L) | Typical use |
|-------------|----------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| 3/8"        | 0.500"   | 0.025"        | 0.030"        | Ice maker, dishwasher supply |
| 1/2"        | 0.625"   | 0.028"        | 0.040"        | Individual fixture supply |
| 3/4"        | 0.875"   | 0.032"        | 0.045"        | Branch lines, main supply |
| 1"          | 1.125"   | 0.035"        | 0.050"        | Main supply, long runs |

Type M (thinnest wall) is acceptable for residential supply in most jurisdictions. Type L is required by some codes and recommended for underground or high-pressure applications. Type K (thickest) is used for underground water service.

## DWV pipe (ABS or PVC Schedule 40)

| Nominal size | Minimum slope | Typical use |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| 1-1/4"     | 1/4" per foot | Bathroom sink drain |
| 1-1/2"     | 1/4" per foot | Kitchen sink, shower, bathtub drain |
| 2"         | 1/4" per foot | Shower drain, washing machine standpipe |
| 3"         | 1/8" per foot | Toilet drain (also accepts 4") |
| 4"         | 1/8" per foot | Building drain, main stack |

## Fixture drain and trap sizes

| Fixture          | Trap size | Drain size |
|------------------|-----------|------------|
| Lavatory (bath)  | 1-1/4"   | 1-1/4"    |
| Kitchen sink     | 1-1/2"   | 1-1/2"    |
| Bathtub          | 1-1/2"   | 1-1/2"    |
| Shower           | 2"       | 2"         |
| Toilet           | integral  | 3" or 4"  |
| Washing machine  | 2"       | 2"         |
| Floor drain      | 2" or 3" | 2" or 3"  |

## Solder joint clearance (copper)

The annular gap between the pipe OD and fitting ID should be 0.001"–0.005". This gap is what allows capillary action to draw solder into the joint. A gap that is too tight starves the joint; too loose and capillary action fails.

## Water supply pressure

| Condition | Typical range |
|-----------|---------------|
| Municipal supply at meter | 40–80 psi |
| Recommended household operating | 40–60 psi |
| Maximum recommended | 80 psi (install PRV above this) |
| Minimum for adequate fixture flow | 20 psi |
