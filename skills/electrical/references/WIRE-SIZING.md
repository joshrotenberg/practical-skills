## NM-B (Romex) cable designations

| Cable  | Conductors           | Typical use |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|
| 14/2   | 14 AWG, 2 + ground   | 15A lighting circuit |
| 12/2   | 12 AWG, 2 + ground   | 20A outlet circuit |
| 12/3   | 12 AWG, 3 + ground   | 20A circuit with switch leg or shared neutral |
| 10/2   | 10 AWG, 2 + ground   | 30A water heater, A/C |
| 10/3   | 10 AWG, 3 + ground   | 30A dryer circuit |
| 8/3    | 8 AWG, 3 + ground    | 40A range circuit |
| 6/3    | 6 AWG, 3 + ground    | 50A range circuit |

## Torque specifications

| Connection type            | Torque     |
|----------------------------|------------|
| 15A/20A receptacle screws  | 12 in-lbs  |
| 15A/20A switch screws      | 12 in-lbs  |
| Branch breaker lugs        | 20–25 in-lbs (check breaker label) |
| Main breaker lugs          | 35–40 in-lbs (check breaker label) |
| Ground bar screws          | 20 in-lbs  |
| Neutral bar screws         | 20 in-lbs  |

## Box fill calculations (NEC 314.16)

| Conductor AWG | Volume per conductor |
|---------------|---------------------|
| 14            | 2.0 cu in           |
| 12            | 2.25 cu in          |
| 10            | 2.5 cu in           |

Count each hot and neutral as one conductor. Count all grounds combined as one conductor. Count each device (receptacle, switch) as two conductors. Count each cable clamp set as one conductor. Total must not exceed the box's listed volume.
