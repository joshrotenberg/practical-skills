# Firing Temperature Reference (Orton Standard Pyrometric Cones)

## Common firing cones

|------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|-------------|
| 022  | 1,112             | 600               | Low fire | Overglaze enamels, luster, china paint |

| 06   | 1,823             | 995               | Low fire | Bisque (earthenware), low-fire glazes |
| 04   | 1,940             | 1,060             | Low fire | Standard bisque temperature |
| 02   | 2,016             | 1,102             | Low fire | Earthenware glaze maturity |
| 01   | 2,046             | 1,119             | Mid fire | Low end of mid-range |
| 1    | 2,079             | 1,137             | Mid fire | |
| 4    | 2,161             | 1,183             | Mid fire | Mid-range stoneware (low end) |
| 5    | 2,167             | 1,186             | Mid fire | Mid-range stoneware |
| 6    | 2,232             | 1,222             | Mid fire | Standard mid-range stoneware and glazes |
| 8    | 2,280             | 1,249             | High fire | |
| 9    | 2,300             | 1,260             | High fire | Standard high-fire stoneware |
| 10   | 2,345             | 1,285             | High fire | High-fire stoneware, some porcelain |
| 11   | 2,361             | 1,294             | High fire | Porcelain |
| 12   | 2,383             | 1,306             | High fire | Hard porcelain |
| 13   | 2,455             | 1,346             | High fire | Industrial, very hard porcelain |

Temperatures are for standard Orton self-supporting cones at a heating rate of 270°F (150°C) per hour. Faster rates raise the endpoint; slower rates lower it.

## Clay body categories

| Category | Cone range | Characteristics |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| Earthenware | 06–02 | Porous after firing, requires glaze to hold liquid. Terracotta. |
| Mid-fire stoneware | 4–6 | Partially vitrified, strong, most common studio clay. |
| High-fire stoneware | 8–10 | Fully vitrified, dense, durable. |
| Porcelain | 8–13 | Translucent when thin, very strong, difficult to throw. |

## Kiln ramp guidelines (electric kiln, bisque firing to cone 04)

| Phase | Temperature range | Rate | Reason |
|-------|-------------------|------|--------|
| Water smoking | Room temp to 212°F | 100–200°F/hr | Drives off atmospheric moisture |
| Dehydration | 660–1,100°F | 200°F/hr | Chemical water (crystal water) leaves clay body |
| Quartz inversion | 1,063°F (573°C) | Slow through this point | Quartz crystals expand 2% — too fast causes cracking |
| Organic burnout | 1,100–1,470°F | 150–200°F/hr | Carbon and sulfur compounds burn out of the clay |
| Final ramp | 1,470°F to cone | 250–300°F/hr | Can ramp faster once volatiles are gone |
| Cooling | Cone to room temp | Natural (lid closed) | Do not open kiln above 200°F |

## Glaze defects

| Defect | Appearance | Cause |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Crazing | Fine network of cracks in glaze | Glaze thermal expansion higher than clay body |
| Shivering | Glaze flakes off the surface | Glaze thermal expansion lower than clay body |
| Crawling | Glaze pulls away from bare spots | Dusty or oily bisqueware, glaze applied too thick |
| Pinholing | Small holes in glaze surface | Gas escaping from clay body during glaze melt |
| Blistering | Large bubbles in glaze | Overfiring, glaze too thick, underfired bisque |
| Running | Glaze drips down toward foot | Overfired, glaze too fluid at temperature, applied too thick at base |
