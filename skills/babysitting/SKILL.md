# Babysitting — Child Supervision, Bedtime Enforcement, and Snack Negotiation

## Overview

Childcare is the continuous supervision and management of one or more small humans who have limited impulse control, no sense of danger, strong opinions about everything, and the ability to sense weakness. Children are non-deterministic systems: the same input (bedtime routine, snack offering, activity suggestion) can produce wildly different outputs depending on variables including hunger, fatigue, recent sugar intake, and whether their parents are still visible.

Success depends on establishing authority early, maintaining consistency, and never making a promise you cannot keep.

## Prerequisites

- Emergency contact information for the parents, written down (not just in your phone — your phone may be dead, lost, or currently being used by a 4-year-old to watch Bluey)
- Address of the residence, for giving to 911 if necessary
- Knowledge of any allergies (food, medication, environmental). Ask the parents explicitly. Then ask again.
- Location of: first aid kit, fire extinguisher, flashlight, and fuse box
- Familiarity with all door locks and window locks
- Snacks, pre-approved by parents. Do not introduce new foods — an allergic reaction during babysitting is a medical emergency and a conversation you do not want to have.
- Age-appropriate entertainment: books, coloring supplies, board games, one (1) approved screen option as a last resort

## Age-Specific Considerations

### Infants (0–12 months)

Infants communicate through crying. The diagnostic flowchart is: hungry → wet/dirty diaper → tired → gas → overstimulated → something else entirely. Work through these in order.

Hold the infant with your hand supporting the head and neck at all times. The neck muscles are not strong enough to support the head independently until approximately 4 months.

Place the infant on their back to sleep. Nothing else in the crib — no blankets, no pillows, no stuffed animals, no bumpers. This is not a suggestion; it is the single most important thing you can do to prevent SIDS.

Warm a bottle by placing it in a bowl of warm water for 2–3 minutes. Test the temperature on the inside of your wrist. It should feel neutral — not warm, not cool. Never microwave a bottle. Microwaves heat unevenly and create hot spots in the liquid that can burn the infant's mouth.

### Toddlers (1–3 years)

Toddlers are mobile, curious, and have no concept of consequences. Your primary job is preventing injury. Scan every room they enter for: small objects (choking), sharp edges (head wounds), accessible chemicals under sinks (poisoning), uncovered outlets (electrocution), and open stairways (falls).

Toddlers have approximately a 2-second attention span for anything you want them to do and unlimited attention for things you don't. Redirect rather than restrict: instead of "don't touch that," offer "let's play with this instead." Removing the forbidden object from the environment is more effective than telling a toddler not to touch it.

When a toddler melts down — and they will — stay calm. Get on their level physically (kneel or sit). Acknowledge the emotion: "You're really upset because you wanted the blue cup." Do not reason with a screaming toddler. They cannot process logic when emotionally flooded. Wait for the wave to pass, then redirect.

### Children (4–10 years)

Children this age can communicate their needs, follow basic instructions, and participate in activities. They also test boundaries systematically.

Establish rules at the beginning: what is allowed, what is not, and what the consequence is. Be specific. "Be good" is meaningless. "We're going to play inside, no jumping on the furniture, and we'll have a snack after we clean up the game" is actionable.

Follow through on every stated consequence. Children learn quickly whether a rule is real or decorative. If you say "one more warning and we turn off the TV," the TV must go off after the next infraction. If it doesn't, every subsequent warning is meaningless and they know it.

## Bedtime

Bedtime is the final boss of babysitting. It is the point at which the child deploys every available tactic: thirst, hunger, one more story, a suddenly urgent need to discuss their day, fear of the dark, a noise they heard, and the assertion that their parents always let them stay up later.

### The routine

Get the bedtime routine from the parents in advance. Follow it exactly. Children rely on routine, and any deviation is both an opportunity for negotiation and a genuine source of anxiety.

A typical routine: bath or wash up → pajamas → brush teeth → one or two books → lights out. The entire sequence should take 20–30 minutes. Do not start bedtime at bedtime — start 30 minutes before.

### The negotiation

After lights out, the child will make a request. This is normal. Have one glass of water ready at the bedside to preempt the thirst request. Allow one post-lights-out interaction (a brief reassurance or one more hug). After that, keep responses brief and boring: "It's time for sleep. I'll be right outside. Goodnight."

Do not engage in conversation, debate, or new activities. The child is testing whether interacting with you is more interesting than lying in the dark. Make the interaction so uninteresting that lying in the dark wins.

### If they get up

Walk them back to bed. Say goodnight. Leave. Repeat. No new conversation, no negotiation, no additional stories. The first night with a new babysitter may require 3–5 returns. Consistency is the only strategy that works.

## Snack Preparation

Children are particular about food in ways that are unpredictable and non-negotiable. A child who ate and enjoyed carrots yesterday may refuse them today on the grounds that they are "wrong." This is not logical. It does not need to be logical.

Offer choices within constraints: "Do you want apple slices or crackers with cheese?" This gives the child a sense of control without opening a negotiation about ice cream.

Cut all food for children under 4 into pieces no larger than 1/2" to reduce choking risk. Grapes must be cut lengthwise (not crosswise) — their round shape and smooth skin are specifically designed by nature to lodge in a small airway. Hot dogs are the same: cut lengthwise first, then into pieces.

Do not offer: whole nuts, popcorn, hard candy, raw carrots, or whole grapes to children under 4. These are the leading choking hazards in pediatric emergency data.

## Emergency Procedures

If a child is choking and cannot cough, cry, or breathe:

For an infant: place the infant face-down on your forearm with the head lower than the chest. Deliver 5 back blows between the shoulder blades with the heel of your hand. Turn the infant face-up and deliver 5 chest compressions with two fingers on the breastbone just below the nipple line. Repeat until the object is expelled or the infant becomes unconscious.

For a child over 1 year: perform abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver). Stand behind the child, make a fist with one hand, place it above the navel and below the ribcage, and thrust inward and upward.

Call 911 immediately if the obstruction is not cleared within 30 seconds.

## Common Mistakes

- Telling the child "your parents will be home soon" when you don't know that. If bedtime is 8:00 and the parents said they'd be home by 11:00, the child does not need to know the timeline. "They'll be home after you're asleep" is sufficient and avoids hourly check-ins.
- Using screen time as a first resort. It works. It works so well that when you need to take it away, the transition is catastrophic. Use it strategically and briefly, not as the default activity.
- Not childproofing your behavior. If you leave your bag on the floor, a toddler will find it and distribute its contents throughout the house. Medications, keys, pens, and coins will be located and investigated. Put your things out of reach.
- Assuming older children don't need supervision. A 7-year-old left alone in a room for 10 minutes can construct a situation that requires professional intervention. Check in regularly.
