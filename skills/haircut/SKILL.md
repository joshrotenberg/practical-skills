# Haircut — Fades, Layers, and Beard Trimming

## Overview

A haircut is the controlled removal of hair using shears, clippers, and/or a razor to achieve a desired shape, length, and texture. The quality of a haircut depends on understanding hair growth direction, head shape, bone structure, and the mechanical properties of the specific hair type. Straight, wavy, curly, and coily hair all behave differently when cut wet versus dry, and the amount of spring-back when dry varies dramatically by curl pattern.

## Prerequisites

- Clippers with a full set of guards: 0 (no guard), 1 (1/8"), 1.5 (3/16"), 2 (1/4"), 3 (3/8"), 4 (1/2")
- Adjustable clipper lever (most professional clippers have a taper lever on the side that opens or closes the blade gap, giving half-steps between guards)
- Detachable blade set if doing skin fades: 000 (0.5mm), 00000 (0.2mm), or a foil shaver for bald skin
- Shears, 6" or 7", convex edge for slide cutting
- Thinning shears (texturizing shears) with 30–40 teeth
- Barber comb (tapered, with fine and wide teeth) and a cutting comb
- Spray bottle with water
- Cape, neck strip, and a hand mirror for the back
- Good overhead lighting. Shadows hide unevenness.

## The Fade

A fade is a graduated transition from very short (or skin) at the bottom to longer on top. The three common fade lines are: low (just above the ear), mid (at the temple), and high (above the temple, near the parietal ridge).

### Step 1: Establish the guide

Start with the shortest length at the bottom. For a skin fade, use a 000 blade or foil shaver from the hairline up to approximately 1" above the ear. For a #1 fade, use a #1 guard to the same height. This establishes your shortest zone.

Cut upward against the grain, flicking the clipper out from the head at the fade line. Do not run the clipper straight up through the fade zone — this creates a visible line rather than a gradient.

### Step 2: Build the gradient

Switch to the next longer guard (or open the taper lever one position) and cut from the hairline up to a point slightly higher than your first pass. Each subsequent guard length extends slightly higher. The overlap between zones is where the blending happens.

For a three-zone fade:
- Zone 1 (bottom): 000 to 1" above ear
- Zone 2 (middle): #1, lever closed, from hairline to about 2" above ear
- Zone 3 (upper): #1, lever open, from hairline to where the head starts to round (the parietal ridge)

The parietal ridge — the widest point of the skull, roughly where the side meets the top — is your natural ceiling for the fade. Above this, the top length takes over.

### Step 3: Blend

This is where most fades fail. The transition zones must be seamless.

Use the clipper-over-comb technique: hold the comb at a slight angle in the transition zone, and run the clipper over the comb to remove only the hair protruding through the teeth. Move the comb slowly upward through the gradient while the clipper follows. Shorter angle of attack = more hair removed. Steeper angle = less.

Alternatively, use the taper lever: place the clipper in the transition zone, engage the blade, and flick the taper lever from closed to open as you move upward through the zone. This progressively increases the cutting length within a single pass.

Check your work frequently. Hold a hand mirror behind the client's head and examine the fade at eye level. Any visible lines (called "steps") need additional blending. Common problem areas are the occipital bone (the bump at the back of the skull) and behind the ears.

### Step 4: Top

Section the hair on top using clips. Starting at the front, comb a section straight up and cut to the desired length using shears, working from front to back. Each subsequent section is cross-checked against the previous one: pull both sections together, and the previously cut hair serves as your length guide.

For a textured, modern look, use point cutting (cutting vertically into the ends of the hair with the tips of the shears) or the thinning shears to remove bulk without changing length.

## Beard Trimming

Establish the neckline: place two fingers above the Adam's apple — the line should curve from behind one ear, down to this point, and up to the other ear. Everything below this line gets shaved clean. A common mistake is setting the neckline at the jawline, which looks unnatural. The correct neckline is under the jaw, following the natural contour of the neck.

For the cheek line, most beards look best with a natural or very slightly cleaned-up cheek line. An overly sharp, straight cheek line looks artificial on most face shapes. Trim only the obvious strays above the natural growth pattern.

Trim the beard to length with a guard on the clipper, combing through as you go to catch hairs lying flat. Finish the edges with a trimmer or straight razor for a clean perimeter.

## Common Mistakes

- Cutting the fade line too high or too sharp on the first pass. Start conservative — you can always take more off, but you cannot put hair back. A line that's too high or too aggressive forces you to extend the fade higher to compensate, which can change the entire shape of the cut.
- Cutting curly or coily hair wet and being surprised when it springs up 1–2 inches shorter after drying. For curly hair types, cut dry or account for the spring factor by leaving extra length. A wet cut on type 4 hair is a gamble.
- Using shears on the top without tension. Hair must be held at consistent tension between your fingers while cutting. Inconsistent tension produces inconsistent length.
- Ignoring head shape. The haircut should complement the skull, not follow it blindly. A flat spot on the crown needs slightly more length. A protruding occipital bone needs the hair below it tapered tighter to minimize the bump visually.
