# The Five Mother Sauces and Their Derivatives

## Overview

The French mother sauce system, codified by Auguste Escoffier, organizes hundreds of sauces into five families. Each mother sauce is a base from which derivative (or "small") sauces are made by adding finishing ingredients.

## Bechamel (white sauce)

**Base:** White roux + milk

| Derivative | Addition |
|-----------|----------|
| Mornay | Gruyere and Parmesan, off heat |
| Soubise | Sweated onion puree |
| Nantua | Crayfish butter and cream |
| Cream sauce | Heavy cream, lemon juice |
| Mustard sauce | Dijon mustard, off heat |

**Roux ratio:** 2 oz butter : 2 oz flour : 2 cups milk (medium consistency). For thin bechamel (souffles), use 1 oz each. For thick (binding), use 3 oz each.

## Veloute (light stock sauce)

**Base:** Blond roux + white stock (chicken, veal, or fish)

| Derivative | Addition |
|-----------|----------|
| Supreme | Chicken veloute + cream + mushroom essence |
| Allemande | Veal veloute + egg yolk liaison + lemon |
| Bercy | Fish veloute + shallots + white wine + parsley |
| Normandy | Fish veloute + mushroom cooking liquid + egg yolks + cream |

## Espagnole (brown sauce)

**Base:** Brown roux + brown stock + tomato puree + mirepoix

| Derivative | Addition |
|-----------|----------|
| Demi-glace | Equal parts espagnole + brown stock, reduced by half |
| Bordelaise | Demi-glace + red wine + shallots + bone marrow |
| Robert | Demi-glace + white wine + onion + mustard |
| Chasseur | Demi-glace + white wine + mushrooms + tomato + tarragon |
| Madeira | Demi-glace + Madeira wine |

## Tomato sauce

**Base:** Tomato puree + stock + aromatics (onion, carrot, garlic, bay leaf)

| Derivative | Addition |
|-----------|----------|
| Creole | Tomato + onion + celery + green pepper + garlic |
| Portugaise | Tomato + garlic + olive oil + parsley |
| Provencale | Tomato + garlic + olive oil + olives + mushrooms |

## Hollandaise (emulsion sauce)

**Base:** Egg yolks + clarified butter + lemon juice (warm emulsion)

| Derivative | Addition |
|-----------|----------|
| Bearnaise | Hollandaise base with tarragon-shallot reduction instead of lemon |
| Choron | Bearnaise + tomato puree |
| Maltaise | Hollandaise + blood orange juice and zest |
| Mousseline | Hollandaise + whipped cream, folded in at service |

**Emulsion temperature:** Maintain the bowl at 140–150°F during whisking. Below 130°F the yolks won't emulsify. Above 160°F the yolks scramble.

## Roux ratios by color

| Roux type | Cook time | Thickening power | Flavor |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| White | 2–3 min | Highest | Mild, starchy |
| Blond | 5–7 min | Medium | Nutty |
| Brown | 20–40 min | Lowest | Deep, toasty |

Thickening power decreases as color deepens because the starch molecules break down during prolonged cooking. A dark roux needs roughly twice the volume of a white roux to achieve the same viscosity.
