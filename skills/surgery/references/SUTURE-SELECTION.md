# Suture Selection Reference

## Suture size

| USP size | Diameter (mm) | Typical use |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| 2-0      | 0.30–0.39     | Fascial closure, large vessel ligation |
| 3-0      | 0.20–0.29     | Deep tissue closure, bowel anastomosis |
| 4-0      | 0.15–0.19     | Skin closure (trunk, extremities), subcuticular |
| 5-0      | 0.10–0.15     | Skin closure (face), small vessel repair |
| 6-0      | 0.07–0.09     | Microsurgery, ophthalmic, pediatric face |

## Absorbable sutures

| Material | Brand names | Absorption time | Tensile strength retention | Common use |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------------|------------|
| Polyglactin 910 | Vicryl | 56–70 days | 75% at 14 days, 50% at 21 days | Deep closure, fascial, bowel |
| Poliglecaprone 25 | Monocryl | 91–119 days | 60% at 7 days, 30% at 14 days | Subcuticular skin closure |
| Polydioxanone | PDS II | 180–210 days | 70% at 14 days, 50% at 28 days | Fascial closure, slow-healing tissue |
| Polyglycolic acid | Dexon | 60–90 days | 65% at 14 days | Deep closure (largely replaced by Vicryl) |
| Plain gut | Gut | 70 days | Unpredictable | Mucosal closure, ligation |
| Chromic gut | Chromic | 90 days | Slightly longer than plain | Mucosal closure, circumcision |

## Non-absorbable sutures

| Material | Brand names | Common use |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Nylon (polyamide) | Ethilon, Dermalon | Skin closure, retention sutures |
| Polypropylene | Prolene, Surgipro | Vascular anastomosis, skin (low reactivity) |
| Silk | Perma-Hand | Ligation, drain fixation (high tissue reactivity) |
| Polyester | Ethibond, Surgidac | Tendon repair, cardiac valve |
| Stainless steel | Flexon | Sternal closure, orthopedic |

## Needle types

| Needle point | Cross-section | Use |
|-------------|---------------|-----|
| Cutting | Triangular, apex on outer curve | Skin, tough tissue |
| Reverse cutting | Triangular, apex on inner curve | Skin (preferred — reduces tissue pull-through) |
| Taper | Round, smooth | Bowel, fascia, peritoneum, deep soft tissue |
| Taper-cut | Taper body with cutting tip | Calcified or fibrous tissue |
| Blunt | Round, blunt tip | Liver, kidney (reduces needle-stick risk) |

## Suture removal timing

| Location | Remove at |
|----------|-----------|
| Face | 5 days |
| Scalp | 7 days |
| Trunk | 7–10 days |
| Extremity | 10–14 days |
| Over joint | 14 days |
| Foot sole | 14 days |
